New session can never find repo. It gets it wrong and then runs git remove -v. So just say to run that to 
check url etc in copilot instructions.

Where do we need to specify this? After every milestone, we should have user-centric dways to interact with the 
system all working. And they should generally be at python level calling core, python calling API, through telegram etc. e./g.  just becuase we added an api we should still be able to interact directly with core code.
So we are generally increasing and enhancing how user can interact. Make files handy for key paths here. Same on running services, showing status, taking them downe etc.  So readme should be good here. This needs to be key so that arch/dev/qa aware of this requirement for each milestone and can test it.
