# Helionyx

Personal decision and execution substrate built on an append-only event log foundation.

## Project Status

**Current Milestone**: Milestone 0 - Architecture Baseline  
**Status**: In Progress

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter the repository
git clone git@github.com:rattling/helio-mono.git
cd helio-mono

# 2. Set up environment (creates .env and data directories)
make setup

# 3. Install dependencies (creates virtual environment)
make install

# 4. Run the walking skeleton demonstration
make run

# 5. Check system status
make status
```

## Services

### Event Store
Append-only event log serving as the system's source of truth.

### Ingestion
Accepts and normalizes inputs from various sources (ChatGPT dumps, Telegram, CLI).

### Extraction
Extracts structured objects (Todo, Note, Track) from messages using LLMs.

### Query
Builds queryable projections from the event log.

### Adapters
Thin translation layers for external interfaces (Telegram, API, CLI).

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **API Framework**: FastAPI
- **Event Storage**: File-based JSONL (append-only)
- **Projections**: SQLite
- **Schema Validation**: Pydantic
- **LLM Client**: OpenAI Python SDK
- **Testing**: pytest

## Development

```bash
# Run the walking skeleton
make run

# Check system status
make status

# Run linters
make lint

# Format code
make format

# Run tests (when implemented)
make test

# Clean generated files
make clean
```
