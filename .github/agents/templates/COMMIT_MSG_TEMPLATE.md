# Commit Message Template

This template is mandatory for all commits.

## Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary> [#<issue>]

Why:
- <why this change was needed>

What:
- <what changed>

Tests:
- <tests run, or "not run" + why>

Notes:
- <follow-ups or risks>
```

## Types
feat | fix | refactor | test | docs | chore | build | ci

## Scope
Optional. Prefer a service or module name (e.g. `api`, `ledger`, `webui`).

## Rules
- Use imperative mood (“add”, “fix”).
- Be specific.
- Always explain *why*.
- If tests were not run, say why.
