Architect agent created milestone 1 changes on milestone 0 branch. i.e. did not start a new branch.
Maybe we assumed developer would do that when it started coding i.e. we didnt anticipate that architect would do any coding? 

The milestones may be a bit big. We could have split this into maybe 3-4 smaller milestones.
What is heuristic for how big a milestone should be? It should be a good chance its achievable within a context window which is 128k tokens. Perhaps we put that in the workflow as a heursitic that the architect could use. Could prompt it in its insructions to break down milestones into smaller ones if it thinks they are too big.
Having said that, maybe bigger the better for cli. Will play this by ear.

I'm not totally clear on how updates milestone meta issue when milestone finished? Do we pass back to architect or does qa do that?
